            <p>Hi, I'm Paru Banjara.</p> <br>
            <p>I am an Information Analysis (IA) Student in Bachelor of Science (BSI) program at the University of
                Michigan. Besides coding, I also have a great passion of exploring in a wide variety of domains, such as
                design, artworks, photography and travelling.</p><br>

            <p>To talk about my past experiences, I have worked at different hospitals in Nepal as a student nurse. I
                have directly worked with patients, clients, community members, and health care teams. I have worked
                with the patients in the most critical situations, such as patient with burn, fracture vertebra,
                post-operative patient, and patient in labor and delivery. Working as a student nurse, I not only
                learned a lot of health care related skills and knowledge, but also gained other soft skills, such as
                working in a team, building interpersonal relationships with people from different domains and
                backgrounds, working under a stressful situation and acting accordingly, and providing counseling and
                health guidance to patients and clients.</p><br>
